# Whalebooks 🐬🐳🐋🌊🐟🐠🐡


This is an ad hoc research group bringing together researchers from UW, APL, and affiliates: Concerning whale data particularly from hydrophones. This landing page includes some start-of-project notes.  


Our first idea is to build a gold-plated dataset of five-second clips that do / do not include biological sounds. The
biological sounds are vocalizations from both baleen and toothed whales, the latter including orcas, dolphins and porpoises. 

* [Whaledr](https://whale-dr.firebaseapp.com/#/play) is the first version of our whale identification game
  * Built on data from the [Regional Cabled Array](https://interactiveoceans.washington.edu/story/The_Regional_Cabled_Array) Oregon Slope Base broadband hydrophone
* The [Bering Sea hydrophone game](http://arcticwhaledr.swipesforscience.org) is currently available
* The [Megaptera game](http://megaptera.swipesforscience.org/#/) is intended for identifying specifically Humpback whales

### Additional remarks

* From Arctic: A3150919_08_1970_01_01T00_00_45_767212Z is a truly excellent low-frequency humpback call
